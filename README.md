# 3-solvers-to-ODEs

In this task, there are three ODE solvers for mathematical model of MallARD. The first solver is named 'ode-45', which is a built-in solver in MATLAB. The rests are built in addition using Runge-Kutta method and euler's method. These models plot some figures out, including surge velocity(u), sway velocity(v) and yaw rate(r). The result is compared with the Figure.6 in IROS_2020 paper using dataset "XYPSI_1".

All of the three models are tested using the datasets form Marin and Keir. Dataset "X" is predominantly excited in X_b by control inputs in F_u. Dataset "Y" and "PSI" excitation is focused on Y_b and by F_v and F_r, respectively.  In the datasets "XTPSI", MallARD was excited in all degrees of freedom and was driven in squares, circles and figures of eight, which are motions that could be expected in practice. 

## Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/Xue1iang/3-solvers-to-ODEs.git

This repo contains a package of datasets, and three MATLAB codes of ODE solver.

## Explanation of the code
in here explain the files and what they do
3 files that all do he same thing using different methods

The code uses experimental data from MallARD. Joypad input and MallARD position are recorded in the experiments. The mathematical model predicts velocities and position using the joypad inputs and identified model coefficients. Model and coefficients were taken from XXXXXXXXXX.
