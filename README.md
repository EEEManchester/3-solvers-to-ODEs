# 3-solvers-to-ODEs

In this task, there are three ODE solvers for mathmatical model of MallARD. The first solver is named 'ode-45', which is a built-in solver in MATLAB. The rests are built in addition using Runge-Kutta method and euler's method. All of the three models are tested using the datasets form Marin and Keir.
